# Ultimate Web Developer Project

Contains everything that I know (and think I know) about web development. 
Exercising my ability to combine things into a definitive project.
=================================
##First Edition & Additions
=================================
I'm using VIM to fully build the project just to re-hash those skills. 
For the build itself, I'm using a custom vim editor with:
1) Emmet
2) Colorizer (For additional creative themes)
3) NerdTree (For opening file trees and paths within VIM)
4) NrrwRgn (For a custom bar at the bottom)

================================
##What I'm building
===============================
A fully hashed out backend in one version initially, with additional customizations in the future.
